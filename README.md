# DS160_Final_Project_RH
### Project Summary Format:
##### Clearly articulate the purpose and objectives of your project.
Using the database of Denver crime acquired at kaggle, I want to investigate what are the different factors that affect the type of crime that is being done in Denver. Some of the factors that I would be looking into would be the location of the crime, the crime_id, offense_id, time, among others. 
##### Provide a brief overview of the scope and key deliverables (dependent variable). 
The dependent variable would mainly be the type of crime that was perpetrated, meaning, it would be a logistic regression as it is a discrete variable. Other possible outputs would be the district or precinct id showing whether certain types of crimes or other factors affect where the crime would be perpetrated.
##### Highlight any innovative aspects or unique features.
Some interesting parts of this project would be (hopefully) a map that shows where the crime was perpetrated, a timetable showing where crime often occurred, and when it is often reported among other things. Since, this is a big dataset, there was a lot of work done in the preprocessing for ease of manipulation later, some of which were not exactly covered in class.
